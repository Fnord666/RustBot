# RustBot
The third iteration of MrPlow on irc.SoylentNews.org, written in Rust. Version one was perl and took up too much ram. Version two was C and corrupted too much ram.

Will NOT currently build and don't expect it to until the maintainer of curl-rust stabilizes v3 and I have the time to refactor my own code to reflect the changes.
